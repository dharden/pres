pres
====

run ./setup, if you use git and cloned things down manually and want to contribute (lol)

If you want to install from github:

    curl https://raw.github.com/deshawnbw/pres/master/install_from_github.sh | $SHELL

Most of the source code is located inside of [bin/_pres_presentation](bin/_pres_presentation)

also, this is not real software

... so far this only works on my ubuntu box? shit... guess thats what ssh is for ;)

Once its working on other shit:

run ./setup, if you want to clone things down manually.

If you want to install from github:

  curl https://raw.github.com/deshawnbw/pres/master/install_from_github.sh | $SHELL

also, this is not real software
